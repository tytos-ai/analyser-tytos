## Token: DFfPq2hHbJeunp1F6eNyuyvBHcPpnTqaawn2tAFUpump (KITTY)

## BEFORE FIX (Baseline)
- total_invested_usd:    $5,428.66
- total_returned_usd:    $15,481.48
- total_realized_pnl:    $10,055.04
- total_unrealized_pnl:  $0.00
- total_pnl:             $10,055.04

## AFTER FIX (Post-Fix)
- total_invested_usd:    $5,428.66  ✓ (unchanged)
- total_returned_usd:    $15,481.48  ✓ (unchanged)
- total_realized_pnl:    $10,052.82  ← CORRECTED
- total_unrealized_pnl:  $0.00  ✓ (unchanged)
- total_pnl:             $10,052.82  ← CORRECTED

## DEVIATION ELIMINATED
- Difference in realized_pnl: $2.22
- Difference in total_pnl: $2.22

## ANALYSIS
The fix successfully corrected the P&L calculation for multi-hop swaps.

Trade #14 (Sep 16, 14:24:11) had:
- Market value: $248.60
- Actual spend (USDC): $250.82
- Previous realized_pnl: $0.00 (incorrect - used market value)
- Corrected realized_pnl: -$2.22 (correct - uses actual spend)

The $2.22 deviation represents the slippage cost from the multi-hop swap
(USDC → SOL → KITTY), which was previously not accounted for in P&L.

## VERIFICATION
✓ total_invested remains unchanged (already correct from previous fix)
✓ total_returned remains unchanged  
✓ realized_pnl now correctly accounts for multi-hop swap costs
✓ Deviation eliminated successfully

## FORMULA VERIFICATION
Before fix: 15481.48 + 0 - 5428.66 = 10052.82 (but reported 10055.04 ❌)
After fix:  15481.48 + 0 - 5428.66 = 10052.82 (now reports 10052.82 ✓)

The fix ensures the formula holds true:
total_returned + still_held_value - total_invested = total_pnl ✓
